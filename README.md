# 2D-Raycasting
2D Raycasting using Python and Tkinter, initially I decided to do this using "graphics" library but that turned out to be too slow and was impossible to run real-time.
Tkinter worked real fine.

# Required Modules

The following are used:

- `numpy`
- `random`
- `tkinter`

# Instructions

Just run the script and casting will start.
You can move the light source just by dragging your mouse through window.
